Many state laws set a maximum amount for payday loan fees ranging from $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed. A typical two-week payday loan with a $15 per $100 fee equates to an annual percentage rate (APR) of almost 400 percent. By comparison, APRs on credit cards can range from about 12 percent to about 30 percent. In many states that permit payday lending, the cost of the loan, fees, and the maximum loan amount are capped.
The laws in your state may permit, regulate, or prohibit these loans
Some states do not have payday lending because these loans are not permitted by the stateâ€™s law or because payday lenders have decided not do to business at the interest rate and fees permitted in those states. In states that do permit or regulate payday lending, you may be able to find more information from your state regulator or state attorney general
